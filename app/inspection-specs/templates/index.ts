1. Size: The outer diameter, inner diameter, and thickness must conform to the specified tolerance limits as per design drawings.
2. Surface Defects:
2.1. Scratches: No visible scratches exceeding 0.5 mm in width or 5 mm in length. Any deep scratches that compromise structural integrity are unacceptable.
2.2. Dents: No dents larger than 0.3 mm in depth or affecting functional surfaces.
2.3. Burrs: No sharp or excessive burrs that could impact assembly or pose safety risks.
2.4. Corrosion: No visible signs of rust, oxidation, or discoloration on the surface.
3. Shape and Symmetry: The nut must maintain its designed geometry, with no deformation or warping that affects functionality.
4. Thread Quality: The internal threading must be free from defects such as cross-threading, damage, or incomplete formation. The nut must properly engage with a standard gauge without excessive resistance.
5. Cleanliness: The nut must be free from oil, grease, dirt, or any other contaminants that could impact performance.
6. Machining Marks: Minor tool marks are acceptable as long as they do not affect the integrity or usability of the nut.
7. Edge Quality: All edges should be smooth and well-finished, with no sharp protrusions that could cause injury or hinder assembly.
8. Overall Acceptability: If a nut fails to meet any of the above criteria, it must be classified as defective and removed from the acceptable lot.`;
